0:00:07 - 0:00:15 Speaker B: Welcome to our special interview. We will discussing the concept of genocide with our esteemed guest, Professor Martin Shaw. Welcome again.
0:00:16 - 0:00:17 Speaker A: Thank you.
0:00:18 - 0:00:26 Speaker B: Professor, I want to ask you, first of all, could you please provide a brief definition of what constitutes a war crime, please?
0:00:28 - 0:00:39 Speaker A: Well, a war crime is a breach of the rules of law, of international humanitarian law, especially concerning the treatment of civilians.
0:00:40 - 0:00:59 Speaker B: As you know, in the region there are lots of war crime is happening and some people do not understand what kind of issue is happening over there. And many people describe events in Gaza as an ethnic cleansing. What's your opinion for this one?
0:01:00 - 0:02:08 Speaker A: Well, the ethnic cleansing is not a legal term. It's a term that is widely used though to refer to the forced removal of a population. And certainly what is happening in Gaza has involved the forced removal of the population. Normally, though that term would be used when it's clear that the removal is permanent. So the fact that people have had to move out of northern Gaza into southern Gaza would only probably be counted as ethnic cleansing if that is a permanent policy or a permanent result and also if it can be said to be intended, the intended consequence. The other thing to say about ethnic cleansing is that it is widely regarded as a euphemism for genocide. The forced removal of populations is frequently regarded as one of the methods of genocide, even though it's not listed as such in the Genocide Convention.
0:02:09 - 0:02:24 Speaker B: They have bombed schools, hospitals and refugee camps. People in Gaza have been subjected to collective punishment. Given all these blunt facts, how do you interrupt, not categorize this action as a genocide?
0:02:26 - 0:03:29 Speaker A: Well, the killing or the killing of civilians in these ways that you're talking about in my view is it would clearly constitute war crimes because it is completely disproportionate to any legitimate military objective that the Israelis may have. So in that sense, I think the individual events, the individual bombings and individual groups of killings would be seen as war crimes. The question of genocide arises because we might say that the overall pattern of what is going on, which is clearly intended by the Israelis and it must be understood when they frame their strategy, amounts to the destruction of Gazan society, at least in the large part. And so that is where the questions of genocide come in. Whether this is a deliberate destruction of Gazan society as a whole. That seems to me to be the question.
0:03:30 - 0:03:46 Speaker B: Four years people in Gaza have faced limited access to food, electricity and water. In light of all these circumstances, what prevents you from characterizing events as a genocide over there?
0:03:47 - 0:06:39 Speaker A: Well, I think we need to talk about the historic events and about the current events. We need to look at them separately, although they are related. The Nakba, the forcible dispossession and removal of the large part of the Palestinian population in 1948, for me, that was clearly a deliberate destruction of Palestinian society. Even though some of the Palestinians fled because of fighting that was going on, the Israelis clearly intended to destroy the Palestinian society because they deliberately refused to allow the return of the Palestinians after the fighting had ceased. From my point of view, this is deliberate destruction of the old Palestinian society, which is a type of genocide. We have to of course, recognize that the number of people who were killed in 1948, the number of victims of massacres by the Zionist forces was relatively small. And of course, some Jews were also killed. But the society, the Palestinian society in most of the territory which became part of Israel was removed and most of the people were not allowed to return. That seems to me to fit into the framework of genocide. And what has happened since then is really that through different stages and different policies, Israel has extended the results of the 1948 Nakba. So on the one hand, through legal dispossession, through the laws which Israel has passed, which govern the position of Palestinians within Israel and of course, also within the occupied territories which are illegally occupied under international law. So that is one means by which this dispossession of the Palestinians has been furthered. The other, particularly important in recent times is through the direct action of Israeli settlers, especially in the west bank, who have been systematically expelling and terrorizing Palestinian civilians out of their land. And of course, there is a section of the Israeli political class, particularly the right wing of the Israeli society, which openly aims to remove the Palestinians from all of historic Palestine. And that is clearly a genocidal aim in the sense that they are attempting to destroy the Palestinian society completely.
0:06:40 - 0:07:25 Speaker B: Mr. Shaw, I. I do not understand. As you know, Jewish people collectively punish punishment by the Nazis regime. And millions of them murdered brutally over there. And what kind of psychology is happening now? You saw in the historical, in your grandfather faced this kind of brutally murdered over there in Nazi regime. And same thing is happening today against these civilians, babies, children. What kind of psychology is this? It's about the complete Zionism or Jewish reality. How do you say that?
0:07:26 - 0:08:05 Speaker A: I think it's very important that we distinguish between the Jewish people and the Israeli state. Many Jewish people oppose what the Israeli government is doing in Israel itself and throughout the world. And it is completely wrong to blame the Jewish people as such for what is happening to, you know, to the Palestinians. Just like it would be wrong to blame the Palestinians as a whole for what Hamas has done to the Jewish people in Israel on October 7th.
0:08:05 - 0:08:05 Speaker B: So.
0:08:07 - 0:09:08 Speaker A: We need to move away from this whole psychology of collective punishment. I think we also need to understand that historically, people who suffer from oppression and from genocide, often their experiences make them very hostile to other groups. And that feeling of victimization can be used by those who want to organize violence and oppression themselves. And that is not unique to Israel. That has happened right throughout the world in all sorts of situations. And what the Israeli government is doing is utilizing the feelings of victimization which the Jews have because of their very real experiences to justify its policies towards the Palestinians. And as I say, other governments do that too.
0:09:08 - 0:09:20 Speaker B: In your opinion, I want to ask this question in the near future, what kind of solution you see in the region, in Palestine and Israel side.
0:09:23 - 0:11:49 Speaker A: At the moment, it's very difficult to see a positive solution to these problems. Hopefully, the international pressure for a ceasefire, the pressure of the Jewish families whose loved ones are still hostage in Gaza, and the pressure in the region, of course, all of these factors will make it difficult for the Israelis to fully resume their present military campaign and to carry on with this brutal process of destruction. So we must hope and we must help to build the international pressure that will prevent this from happening in the medium term. The only solution is some sort of political agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. And what is necessary for that? I think there are a number of things that are necessary. One I think is for Israel to recognize the injustice of the occupation and the injustice of the Nakba, for political forces on both sides to start to pursue peaceful strategies. Never again, I think, should the any Palestinian force carry out atrocities such as those were carried out on October 7th. It works both ways. You know, I think if you. But to have a peaceful solutions the crisis, we need leaders to come forward on both sides who are interested in justice and peace. And I think this is where it's very important that the international pressure is maintained. Because one of the worst things has been to see, which is the same sort of thing that Russia did in Ukraine. When it came to Ukraine, the Western governments protested about what Russia was doing in Palestine. The Western governments are allowing Israel to carry out these atrocious policies. So I think we need to increase the pressure on governments, especially in the west, to. To change their policies.
0:11:50 - 0:11:55 Speaker B: So thank you very much. To answer my question.
0:11:56 - 0:11:59 Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Nice to talk to you.
0:11:59 - 0:12:00 Speaker B: Have a nice day.
0:12:00 - 0:12:02 Speaker A: Same to you. Thank you. Bye.
