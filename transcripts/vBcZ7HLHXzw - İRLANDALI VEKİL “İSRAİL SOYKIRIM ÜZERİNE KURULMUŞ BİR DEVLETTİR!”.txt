0:00:00 - 0:00:39 Speaker A: Palestinians from their homes in northern Gaza and ethnically cleanse them. A crime against humanity. They stated publicly and have and every minute children are being slaughtered by their artillery, their relentless bombardment of residential complexes, of hospitals, of schools, of civilian infrastructure. They just go on and on and on and you do nothing. Israel for ongoing decades long, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, crimes against humanity, the denial of the most basic rights to the Palestinian people. As Gideon.
0:00:45 - 0:01:18 Speaker B: Hello Dear followers of the Kitab Tasmas, today we are honored to Host Irish lawmaker Mr. Richard Boyd Barrett Barrett is a member of Irish Parliament and affiliate with the people before private party. He has become the one of the rare voice in the west lately criticizing the attitudes of the western states regarding the Palestinian issue. Through his pages he will share insight with us on current significant issues. Mr. Barrett, welcome. We are delighted to host you on our channel.
0:01:20 - 0:01:22 Speaker A: Hello Amos, it's nice to be here.
0:01:23 - 0:01:36 Speaker B: Thank you. First of all, I would like to ask you what role do you think the international community should play regarding the inhuman practice carried out by Israel in its military operation in Palestine?
0:01:38 - 0:04:22 Speaker A: Well, I think it is long past time that the international community needs to stop treating Israel as if it is a normal state, as if it is a democratic state. This is a narrative that is promoted by the international community that Israel is some sort of outpost of democracy and that it is a normal state that has the right to, quote, defend itself. And I think this is so far from the truth and we now the world is seeing this. The Palestinians have known since 1948 that Israel was not a normal state. And many, many people in the world have known this and said it again and again for decades, that Israel is not a normal state, that it is a state that was built on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians since 1948, that it is an apartheid state, it is a state engaged in an illegal occupation of Palestinian territory, that it is involved in illegal annexation of Palestinian territory, that is involved in a criminal siege of Gaza. For 16 years the Palestinians have known this. Many, many people have known it. Many human rights organizations have said this again and again and again. But the west has ignored this, denied this, lied about this, and continued to treat Israel as if it's a normal state. But I hope now it is beyond doubt after the genocide that Israel has conducted in Gaza over the last three months, that finally they must begin to admit this is not a normal state. It is a state capable of genocide and it is a capable stay built on ongoing crimes against humanity and against the Palestinians. So that's the change that needs to take place. And once you acknowledge those things, once the international community acknowledges those things, then they have to begin to treat Israel in the way we treated apartheid South Africa. We need to isolate them. We need to stop trade, political, economic relations with them. We need to force them to dismantle this regime of oppression and occupation. That's what they should be doing. But I think we've quite a long way to go before they actually do that.
0:04:22 - 0:04:34 Speaker B: Yes, you are right. Mr. Barrett, Western media often present news about the Israel Palestinian war. From the perspective of Israel, what could be the main reason for this situation?
0:04:36 - 0:07:09 Speaker A: Well, I think President Biden, the US President a number of years ago really brilliantly captured the actual relationship between the Western powers and Israel when he famously said if Israel did not exist, the United States would have to invent Israel. And he went on to say that we would have to station tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the Middle East. So here was a, a, a rare admission about the real connection between Western powers, particularly the United States itself, but also previously Britain, the support of some of the big former colonial powers in Europe, that for them Israel is a strategic asset of Western power and interests in the Middle East. And so it has nothing to do with protecting Jewish people. It really has nothing to do with religion at all. What it has to do with is the desire of Western powers for at least since the beginning of the 20th century to control and dominate the Middle East. And they see it as a strategic military asset whose main purpose is to prevent the self determination not just of the Palestinian people, but the people of the entire region. Because the thing that the United States fear, in my opinion, and that Britain before them feared and that the big European powers fear is they fear the self determination of the people of the region. Because of course that would challenge in a very serious way the interests of the big Western oil corporations that collude with some very, very corrupt and despotic regimes in the region who are also part of the architecture of Western domination of that region. So I think he has summed that relationship up very clearly and all the rest is propaganda. This is the truth. This is the actual relationship. And Israel could not survive without the support and sponsorship and military and financial and political assistance of the United States, Britain and some of the major Western European powers.
0:07:10 - 0:07:20 Speaker B: Yes, I will have a few questions about the United Kingdom. Mr. Bar, how do you evaluate the role of the United Kingdom in the region during this process?
0:07:22 - 0:11:44 Speaker A: Yes, well, the United Kingdom, of course, was the, the initial promoter of the Zionist movement and its relationship to Zionism is Particularly familiar to people in Ireland because, of course, Ireland was the first of the British Empire's colonies. We had been colonized by Britain for hundreds of years as their nearest neighbor. And like the Middle east, they saw Ireland as a place they could plunder resources. And in order to justify a very, very brutal colonial project in Ireland for many hundreds of years, they had dehumanized the Irish in a very, very similar way to the way they dehumanize Palestinians today and dehumanize people of the Arab and Muslim world and indeed, previously, the way they've dehumanized people in Africa. They presented us as subhuman, less than civilized, prone to violence, not rational. All these stereotypes, which I think people of the Middle east are very familiar with those stereotypes. And the Palestinians, very similar. They. They developed this system. And in fact, in Ireland, we had apartheid laws imposed, like the apartheid that is imposed on the Palestinians called the penal laws. And they were laws of religious and ethnic segregation and apartheid that were imposed in Ireland. And they were all part of a policy of divide and rule to subjugate the Irish people and to divide the resistance to the British colonial project. So Britain then exported this model that they had pioneered in Ireland to Palestine very, very consciously. In fact, some of the key architects, like Balfour, like Lord Palmerston, various others, Winston Churchill, all of these people were sort of pioneers and instrumental in the colonial subjugation attempts to crush the Irish revolutionary movement. And they were also key figures in promoting the Zionist project. And again, their agenda with Palestine was brilliantly summed up, and it drew the analogy with Ireland very explicitly by the Governor General of Jerusalem, the British Governor General of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald Storrs. And he said, when he was describing why, why did Britain support the Zionist project? This is before the establishment of the Israeli state, but where it was clear Britain was promoting this agenda, he said, and I'm quoting him directly, he said, we are going to establish a loyal little Jewish Ulster in the Middle east to protect against a potentially hostile sea of Arabism. So Ulster is a province in Ireland which Britain had settled in or as part of the colonial subjugation of Ireland, and it was instrumental in creating a division between Catholic and Protestant in order to control Ireland. So very consciously, they said, we're going to bring this model to Palestine. We're going to create a division between the Muslim people, the Jewish people, Christian people, in order to control the region and divide possible resistance in the region to British rule, to British dominance and influence. So this was the agenda very, very conscious. And many of the Same personnel. In fact, it might be interesting for you to know that some of the military personnel that were involved in the attempt to crush the Irish Revolution between 1918 and 1921, which they did not succeed, I'm glad to say. The Irish revolution triumphed at least in two thirds of the country. Not all of Ireland, but in 2/3 of the country. But many of the military personnel that were involved in trying to crush the Irish revolution were then sent directly to Palestine to assist in the the British mandate and in the promotion of Zionism. So there's a very, very close connection. But Britain was a key architect in all of this and their agenda was dominant domination of the Middle East.
0:11:44 - 0:11:51 Speaker B: In your opinion, how much does the approach of the British government contribute to the resolution of the Israel Palestine war?
0:11:53 - 0:15:24 Speaker A: Well, I mean, I think you can see, can't you, with the UN Security Council vote, the shameful decision of the United States to veto the UN Security Council calling a resolution calling for a ceasefire. Britain didn't vote against, but they abstained. I mean, really shocking that in the face of a genocide in Gaza, the, you know, the blatant massacre of Gazans, the destruction of the infrastructure necessary to sustain human existence in Gaza. That's what's happening. The United States votes against even a ceasefire and Britain abstains. And so we can see this relationship, you know, the. Now the United States has replaced Britain as the major imperial power in the world, but Britain is the junior partner of U. S. Imperialism. The relationship used to be the other way around, but now Britain is the junior partner but still has aspirations to be a power in the world. This is quite important because of course, if we could change policy in Britain, it would be a difficulty for the United States, it would further isolate the United States. And I think something that's quite important for us to think about at the moment is if we look back to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, the international momentum of boycott against apartheid South Africa built over a period of many years. Obviously the critical factor was the resistance of black South Africans themselves. But then there was a huge international movement starting from the grassroots internationally, but then forcing governments to begin to isolate apartheid Africa. But who were the last two countries right up until the end, who continued to support apartheid South Africa even when the whole world had said, this regime is disgusting, it must end? Of course, the United States and Britain, so they have a long history of defending horrible colonial, racist regimes because that's part of their, part of their armory in trying to influence and dominate the world and control resources and Maintain spheres of influence as they call them, so that it is an important one. I'm glad to say there is growing resistance in Britain. I was on a big demonstration in London at the weekend. Huge numbers of British people reject British complicity with Israel. But the difficult situation in Britain is that we have a Tory right wing government who are disgusting and very, very sort of pro imperialist and racist. But tragically the main opposition party led by Keir Starmer is pathetic, absolutely pathetic and disgustingly complicit with the, with Israel's crimes, echoing all of the talking points of Israeli propaganda. So this is a problem in British politics. I don't think it reflects the views of huge numbers of British people, but it is a problem in British politics. And so fairly radical and dramatic political change is necessary. A political alternative that is genuinely anti imperialist is necessary, necessary in, in Britain.
0:15:24 - 0:15:57 Speaker B: Mr. Bird, in recent days there have been some attempt attacks in West. Some news channels are specifically attributing these attacks to Muslim immigrants. Subsequently right wing anti immigrant groups are taking to the streets. Last week, a few weeks ago, I'm sorry, it was stated that behind the events in Dublin there is a lunatic holy function based on far right ideology. What are your thoughts on the rise of such ideological groups and their turning to the violent actions?
0:15:58 - 0:19:32 Speaker A: Yes, it's very worrying, the growth of the far right. I think the first thing we need to say is that the, it is the governments and the big colonial and imperialist powers that have created the narrative for the far right by dehumanizing people in Africa, in the Middle east, people of color, people from the global South. So it is the governments themselves, the mainstream of Western politics, if you like, that creates the narrative of dehumanization and colonialism which then create, develops the poison which the far right then use and take it in even more dangerous direction. And that's what we are seeing. And I think of course some of the support for this far right poison that is directed against Muslim people, it can be directed against Jewish people as well. I mean there is a real phenomenon of anti Semitism not to do with Israel. But you know, we, we know there's a history of anti Semitism, there's a history of Islamophobia, there's a history of anti black racism. And the far right obviously take that in a very, very dangerous direction and we see violent, often violent reprisals and abuse of Muslim or non white, Western, non white people in Europe. So it is very, very worrying. And of course, you know, we have to remember that the horrors of Nazism and fascism in the 30s and 40s. And we must make sure that never happens again. But I do think it is an important point to make that as well as directly confronting this racism and these stereotypes, we also need to recognize that some of the support that these ideas get is because of desperation around issues like housing, the cost of living, the crisis in health services and other public services in Europe. And it's sort of convenient for governments that have failed people on these issues to then scapegoat to blame immigrants when they're not to blame. It's the governments themselves who were to blame. And so I think an important part of challenging the far right fascist racist groups is not just to confront them directly, but is also to say what is the real problem? You're right to be angry about housing, but don't blame the immigrants. Blame, you know, the big investment funds that are speculating on property and making money out of property at the expense of people who actually need homes. And so I think we, we've got to kind of, we've also have to address those real issues, but in a way that's progressive and that points to the real problem, which is economic inequality in the world and the huge gap between the rich and poor. Rather than blaming immigrants who actually are part of the solution, not part of the problem. Because it's immigrants who keep our health services running in much of Western Europe. It's immigrants who often are building the houses we need, working on the public transport systems, working in many of our industries. So immigrants are a benefit to Western Europe, but often they get scapegoated by the far right and by mainstream governments.
0:19:32 - 0:19:43 Speaker B: I would like to ask you lastly, what strategies would you suggest to effectively combat anti immigrants sentiment and extremism in Europe and worldwide?
0:19:44 - 0:22:56 Speaker A: Well, I think I've more or less said it there in, in my last contribution. I think it's, it's a twin track strategy that is needed. On the one hand, we have to directly confront the far right and the fascist groups. Now they are still minority groups, but sadly they're growing in some parts of Europe very seriously growing in particular countries. So we have to directly challenge them and we have to build a broad united front of people who are opposed to racism and to the. And we have to warn people about the dangers of the far right, where it can lead. And we need to remind people of the horrors of fascism and Nazism, because even people who maybe have some racist ideas can also recognize the danger of going back to the horrors of the 1930s and 40s so I think we need to have a sort of anti fascist united front is part of the solution. But I do think also we need to then redirect what is sometimes genuine concern or hardship around issues like housing, employment, public services, which are not the fault of immigrants, but do our real problems that exist and we have to give solutions to those because it is desperation that sometimes leads people to scapegoat other people. You know, it's like I can't punch up, so I punch down. And I think that's. We need to encourage people to punch up and identify the real problem, that the real culprits for the problems that people genuinely face are actually their own governments and often their tiny groups of very, very wealthy people who dominate these big multinational companies that are hoovering up vast amounts of profit and wealth in, in housing is a particular problem in Ireland, for example. And you can see there's a small group of people in Ireland are making a fortune from a very significant housing crisis. So what is hurting most people is benefiting a small group of people. And we need to point to that being the real problem. And that has nothing to do with immigrants. That has to do often with Irish very rich people or international investment funds, often based in New York or London, who are buying up property, charging outrageous rents and prices, speculating. So yeah, we need to redirect people's energy towards the real problem. So that's how I see it. Combat the racists, challenge their stereotypes, their racist narrative, and then simultaneously redirect people's concern about real issues towards the real problem, which is a system that puts profit before people when we need to put people before profit.
0:22:56 - 0:23:09 Speaker B: Mr. Bert, thank you so much. You are. Kindly answer all my question. Thank you for all your answering. And do you want to add something?
0:23:11 - 0:24:51 Speaker A: No. Well, I would only say, Amos, that it's a very dark hour for the people of Gaza and we need to continue to build the movement of solidarity very urgently because there's no atrocity that Israel is not capable of or that the United States is not capable of, or the supporters of Israel. We saw that in Iraq. We've seen it again, you know, go back a few decades. We saw it in Vietnam. These regimes are capable of terrible horrors. So we must stand with the Palestinian people. But I also think the world's eyes are being opened to the reality of these big powers and to the nature of the Israeli regime and that we have seen tremendous mobilizations all across the world. Real humanity, internationalism, people standing together, different colors, nationalities and creeds. This is the force that can change the world. I think people shouldn't feel powerless. As horrible as the situation is that movement across the world. We have to challenge our governments that continue to be complicit. Governments in Europe, but also governments in the Middle east that are complicit with these powers. We need the people to rise up and demand an end to complicity, but also to change in the world that starts to put the needs of ordinary people first. Instead of the needs of arms companies and oil companies and, you know, big multinational companies. Let's put the people first. And so I. I think that's what we need. This is a moment of truth for the world and for humanity. So let's make sure that we begin to create that international movement of solidarity and change.
0:24:53 - 0:24:55 Speaker B: Absolutely. You are right. Thank you so much again.
0:24:57 - 0:24:58 Speaker A: Thank you. Amit.
