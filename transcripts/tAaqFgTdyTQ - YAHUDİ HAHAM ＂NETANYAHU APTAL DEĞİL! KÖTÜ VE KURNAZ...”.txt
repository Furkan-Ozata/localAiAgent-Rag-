0:00:08 - 0:00:24 Speaker B: YouTube channel. Today we focus on examining the historical background of the Israel and Palestine conflict in the region. We are happy to have Rabbi David Ways as our guest from New York. Hi Mr. Ways. We are honored to have you join us.
0:00:24 - 0:00:28 Speaker A: Yeah, it's honored. So privilege to be on your show.
0:00:29 - 0:00:49 Speaker B: As you know, recent conflicts between the ISRA and Palestine make it necessary for us to examine the relationship between the Judaism and Zionism more closely. Therefore, today I would like to ask an important question about the differences between the Judaism and Zionism. I mean, what distinguishes a Jew from a Zionist?
0:00:49 - 0:41:25 Speaker A: This issue is very critical to know and to understand because the conflict, the occupation I should say that's a one four sided conflict. It's an occupation of a people. The state of Israel occupying an indigenous population, the Palestinian people. This is being done in the name of religion of Judaism. The state of Israel is Israel is Jacob. That was his name. They used the star of David as their symbol. They use all the symbols and trappings of Judaism. They made a rabbinate and a chief rabbi and all the strappings. That would be as if this would be some type of a j. Religious a concept, something to do with the religion Judaism. In truth, Judaism is totally contradictory, the opposite of the Zionist state of Israel. Antithetical. It is totally the opposite. As I say, it's from one side to the other, like from day to night. Judaism is a religion of 3,000 years. 3,000 years ago, Moshe Rabbeinu Moses went on Mount Sinai. If the God took us out miraculously out of Egypt. He went on Mount Sinai, had all the Jewish people there were around, around the Mount Sinai and he went up and took the Torah from God. God gave him the Torah. The Torah is the Bible, the five books of Moses. And he gave this as a covenant that we made a covenant with God, a bond with God. And he gave us the Torah to be the laws of what we are supposed to do under this covenant, under this cup that we made with God and 613 commandments in the Torah. There's many, many rules and laws and regulations. And basically it is what we as Jews said we're going to be. We said we're going to be subservient to you. We're going to listen and obey all your commands. That was what Judaism was and Judaism was and is. We are. It's with the words of God. All the Jewish people at that time saw and heard God speaking to Moses. It was something that was part of the miracles. Just like the splitting of the sea. They all Saw God took them out of Egypt, this fleeting with the sea afterwards. One of the requirements of God was that they must go up to the Holy Land. These were miracles. This was a godly issue that it's like I'm not able to fathom for us. But nobody refuted this. We're people of the book. There was never a gap in our history. Every generation passed this on to Genesis that they all saw. This wasn't that one single person said, I saw this, I heard this. The whole community, the whole Jewish nation saw this. And we kept this religion since then. We accepted this bond, this covenant. Basically in the Torah, the five books of Moses, when God required us to go up to the land. It says many times in the Torah that you have to be on a very high level, especially high level of holiness in order to remain as a nation in the Holy Land. If not, it's a holy land. It's just like the body rejects the foreign objects. You can't put in a heart transplant a kidney to whatever. They'll have to. They give medication that the body should not reject because it's sensitive. The land will reject us. And, and then when we went in like I 3,000 years ago, we went in. King Solomon later built the temple and he warned us that if we will be driven from the land, that we should not attempt to return as a nation. We should not attempt to return en masse in large numbers. We have to be loyal citizens in any country where Jew is residing. In the United States, in Iran, in Canada, in Turkey, wherever he's residing. He has to be a loyal citizen to that land and obey the laws, pray for the well being of that land. This was. Jews accepted this and basically he said, do not attempt to leave exile. That's an oath that God put us on to do not return en masse in large numbers, do not rebel against nation and do not attempt to leave exile. So that's 2,000 years ago, the destruction, King Solomon's temple. He built it, but it was destroyed around 2,000 years ago. The temple was destroyed and we were sent into exile, dispersed amongst all the nations. That happened through the Roman Empire, the, the Greek Empire. We were dispersed and we were but were stringently warned that this did not happen because of some physical weakness, because we didn't have an army when God wanted, he made miracles with us, you know, so we were never counted on guns to be our power. The power was God. And when God decided that we had to be dispersed amongst the nations, as in all the prophecies Jeremiah Ezekiel, Isaiah, all the prophets. And you can look and you'll see that they warned the Jewish people that they're not on that level, that's required to be there as a nation. And we knew, knew every new Jew knew that we would not be able to return. We're not able because it's against God's will. So Jews never attempted. We went through the Inquisition, the Crusades, when we were being persecuted in Europe and Spain and Portugal. They tortured the Jews if they would not convert to Christianity. So and we were banned from countries. It was the Muslim countries that took us in. This is a fact through history. So even though we have a distinctly different religion, there's Islam, there's Judaism, but we all believe in one God. And the Muslim countries embraced the Jews and gave them a safe haven, a home. There were no human rights groups to protect us. We simply lived there and flourished in the Muslim countries for hundreds of years. That's the history that we had. That's our religion. Zionism came around 150 years ago. It was a movement of non religious Jews as a whole, almost entirely non religious. They detested religion and they went along and they decided they want a national home. Now, this is not Judaism. We're not looking for a national home. Our issue is to serve God. And maybe I should add, part of the Jewish religion is we always yearn to return because we believe God dispersed us amongst the nations. But we know that ultimately we are lacking this closeness to God that we had when God took us in, when we had the temple. And we know that God promised us that eventually God will make a miracle metaphysical change in the world where all humanity will recognize one God, they'll stop being atheists, everybody will recognize one, and then all humanity will serve God. And God will rebuild the temple, not through like King Solomon did. This will be from God himself, without any human intervention. So it's a spiritual concept. And then we will all humanity will serve God in harmony. So we pray and yearn for that change in the world that we are hoping will happen every day. We pray for this. And then we believe we will return to the Holy Land and serve God as a nation. God will make the Messiah Mashiach, and there will be either King David or from his descendants. So it's something that is the Jewish basics that we pray every day in our prayers to return to Jerusalem. But our concept of returning to Jerusalem has nothing to do because we wanted to have a piece of land, a piece of real estate. It's a closeness to God. And when we were living in the Muslim countries. They never found it as a. Some impediment to peace or to cause. They never looked at us as people who are aspiring to take over the land or something of that nature because they understood. They were scholars. The Muslim imams and the shaykhs, whatever, they were all scholars. They knew what it says in the Torah. It's no secret. And they knew that, yes, that we aspire to return as a Judaism and that God will build the temple. We say that God will build the temple, but it never was any problem. What will happen in the future. Muslims believe one thing will happen. We believe something else will happen. And as we are to this day, we as Jews are simply Jews who are obeying the Torah. They're trying to be subservient to God. They're emulating God. Just as God is compassionate, we have to be compassionate. We have to do charity, we have to do good. So it was never a problem of coexistence. That was our history. Zionism came and they were totally estranged from the religion. We're talking about non religious Theodor Herzl, Ben Gurion, Chaim Weizman, all these, you know, all these begin. All these guys. So what they wanted was a nationalism. And they turned and they said, oh, we're going to make this national home and we're going to gather the Jews together from Europe and we're going to make a national home. The rabbis, as I say, said to us that first of all, they said, that's not Judaism. You're making your national movement, call it Satan, call it something, whatever you want to call it, but don't call it Judaism. That's not what Judaism is. Judaism is to obey the Torah, to simply serve God and to yearn for his closeness. So they said that's first of all wrong. So in essence, Zionism is a transformation from religion to nationalism. That's the first concept. You have to know that it's totally a whole other issue. Secondly, why they want such a. One of the excuses they had many of the mantra, if you'll speak to his Highnesses, hey, where was God protecting us by the Crusades, Inquisition? Where was you? You're depending on God, you're looking for God for protection. God is. You see, God didn't help us. They scorn and they ridicule the religious Jew. We are going to take a Ghana Uzi. We're going to take something, we're going to protect ourselves. That's the, that's the solution. So first, so again it's, it's predicated it's built on a rebellion against, on heresy. That God can't protect us, that we're fools for looking to God for protection. We're going to protect ourselves with the gun. So again, it's totally contradictory to what Judaism is. Our religion is totally in belief in God. So in every issue, the concept of what it is, nationalism, the concept that God can protect us, it's totally, totally the opposite of what is Judaism. On top of that, we were put on the oath, as I told you, we were put on the oath that since 2000 years ago, since the destruction of the temple, we were warned by God. God foresaw that there will be people who will be impatient without being dispersed. And he warned us, do not return en masse. We say every Jew says in his prayers, because of our sins we are dispersed amongst the nations. I'll translate exactly. Because of our sins we were sent into exile from our land. So our Rabb rabbis warned them that every aspect of Zionism, every facet the way you turn it, it's one rebellion against God. It's blasphemy, it's heresy and it's rebellion in its actual actions of creation. So the rabbis from day one stood in total, total opposition to the state. I show this picture of, I mean first of all, how we used to live together in peace and harmony, Jews and Arabs, because we have a difference of religion. But it was never in Pettiman, just it wasn't in Turkey, it wasn't in Palestine. And he took the. He let the Jews come in and we lived there. We flourished under the Ottoman Empire, that's clear. And we were living there for hundreds of years because the difference of religion was not the issue, was not an impediment to coexistence. Basically a Jewish person is a Jewish person. He sees, he covers his head and everything. The Zionists, when they made their state here you have, like I say, you know, you see that one of them is covering the head. They're making a Jewish state. Imagine making a Muslim state without an imam. David Ben Gurion, that's the first prime minister reading the Declaration of a Independence in 1948. Independence hall and the Hasidic at the days you see all their movers and shakers. Not one of them is covering the head and which a Jew is required. It's a law that a Jewish male has to cover said so we believe Zionism came and they were mostly children already of these reformed Jews. So they did. They didn't even start off religious and basically they Came along and they said, we want a national home. It's. They had a group of people that was their, their movement and they said, we want a national home. The rabbi said, unacceptable. They didn't care. They laughed at the rabbis. They didn't have anything to do with them. And they decided they're going to go. They had a meeting in, in Switzerland. Basel, Switzerland 1890s where they decided that they're going to go maybe to Uganda, because they're looking for a lush land, a productive land. In those days, today it's computers, technology. In those days, it was produced that, you know, if the land is good. But then they decided that they need a tremendous amount of backing in order to create a country, a state, a sovereignty. So they decided a very simple solution. They'll go to Palestine. You go to Palestine, you'll tell the world, hey, God gave us. In the Torah it says, God gave the children of Israel the land of Israel. We are taking back. We are the beginning of God's redemption. They call themselves the beginning of God's redemption. They decide even though Palestine was not so was pretty dry in a lot of areas, it wasn't this much more support from the world. And that's true. The advanced evangelistic Christians still today back to millions and millions and millions of people, much more than the Jewish nation, the Jewish people. They have the evangelist Christians say, yeah, the children of Israel, the land of Israel, it's a blessing to support them and help them and. And then there's the unaffiliated Jews, the Jews who don't know their religion. So they were able to calm them and say, yes, we're doing what God, you know, promised us, the land so we can go back there. Now we finally are able to, to fulfill the dream of returning to the land. They're playing on the emotions and they know that every j yearns to return. So they use this emotional concept that is basically what Zionism is. But they're breaching every law of the Torah. But on top of that being that they chose Palestine. They went, they. So they, they have a problem because Palestine wasn't a desert, it wasn't a wilderness, wasn't an empty land. It was inhabited. Therefore, now in order to create the state, they have a problem, a technical problem with the people living there. This is before computers, before, you know, satellites to show what's happening. Maybe you had a few radio, there was television. I don't think there was. There was, it was, I think even prior to television when they started their movement, of course it was and therefore they were able to tell the world, oh, it's a land without a people. It's a. For a people without a land, we need a country and it's a land. And that they, they were able to connect with the media, major media outlets. And that's what they told everybody. Oh, we're going to a land that's pretty much basically empty. But then there was a problem that people started going against them, fighting what they're doing. So the world started asking what's happening there? What's going on in your corner of the there. You know, when they started moving up to Palestine, I'm talking before the state, 1900, 1910. And it started being agitation and trouble. And the Jews actually were living there. Many, many Jews were living there. But not as a nation. We had people from throughout the generations. God told us we're forbidden to go as a nation, but as individuals, people live there. The majority of the inhabitants of Palestine was the Muslim community, by far the majority. The second largest community was the Christian community. The third was the minority was the Jewish community. And they were very holy community. They lived in the same courtyards, they babysat each other's children. They lived in total harmony as they did in many other Muslim lands. The difference of religion never interfered with our coexistence. When the Zionists started trickling in in 1900 and so forth and the 1890s and so forth started coming this movement. So they even sold them properties. The Muslim people sold them properly, why not? They knew the Jews, they're not a problem. But then all of a sudden they started realizing that these guys aren't simply coming here to buy property, to live their lives. They're here to create sovereignty over the place. And then they started being contention and they stopped and they refused to sell them land. And, and this movement started. This movement is not God fearing, this is what Zionism is. So they started agitating, they started making trouble. And of course we call the history, the sad history of Deir Yassin and all the different places that they destroyed villages, over 400 villages. This was not Judaism. Backers of the Zionist movement were in Europe. The Zionists came from Austria, from Germany. Theodor Herzl was in Austria, was in Vienna. And the ones. And the Chaim Weitzman, who was the first president of the state of Israel had given for Britain. He was a scientist and he discovered something like dynamite. And he gave this to Britain and it was saved by World War I. So they wanted to return him a favor. They said, what can we do for you? We'd like to, he said help me make the state of Israel. And they helped them. So after World War I, as everybody knows, Palestine was under British mandate, British control and they gave, they, they basically backed the Zionists to create the country. It went so far as that when the Zionists came up there under British rule, declared that the Jewish community has to be registered under the Zionists. The Jewish community that was living there hundreds of years that looked at the Zionists as sinners, as heretics, as the worst enemy of our people and yet Britain made a declaration that we have to register under them. Our rabbis would fought to the teeth today. They should be able to extract themselves from that. They shouldn't have to. And they were able to with if you, you have to sign and this is that nail that you shouldn't have to register under the Zionist they were able to accomplish this. This was in the 1920s under this, first of all, we're not allowed to have a state. Second of all, to create the state the Zionists had the indigenous people there, this Muslim community as a large and also the Christian. And of course they didn't want to be occupied, they didn't want this Jewish thing. When they realized what was happening, they stopped selling the homes to the Brit, to the Zionists and it was fighting and people were being killed. So in order to create that state, the Zionists had to use force occupying. And that's against the words of the Torah. My religion says do not kill, do not steal. Just as God is compassionate, you must be compassionate, you must do kindness. It's the whole Torah is replete. That's what our commandments are, that we should be subservient to God, emulate God, be a holy nation. That's again a totally against the Torah. It's a cardinal sin. So our rabbis in every aspect said no, this is not us, we're standing in opposition. They went, they stood up and they were being murdered. Not from 1948, mind you, not that 75 years ago when the state was created. Oh, here's the book. I knew I had it in my thing. Here the rabbis speak out. This is a compilation of 130 years of Jewish opposition to Zionism. And we have. These are tens of thousands of rabbis but these are the major leaders of the Jewish communities from Sparta, Ashkenazik around the world. Each one in their manner spoke about their opposing to Zionism in Lithuania. His name was Rabbi Israel Meira Cohen. He was very famous because he was a codifier of Jewish law that Everybody uses today. And he wrote, he said, the Zionists are dead limbs of our people, which causes the entire body to rot. In other words, they cause the entire Jewish body to rot because they're spoiled, they're rotten. And he passed on in 1933 before the state. So I'm just showing in Europe they were opposed to them in the most strongest terms. The Jewish rabbis, they went, they demonstrated from day one. The rabbis demonstrated in Palestine, but not only the rabbis demonstrated. People went on the street and were never armed. Jewish people don't carry guns. Nobody could accuse us of all these years that we have a shot of gun. And here you can see we went and simply, peacefully demonstrated in the streets of Jerusalem. Here you can see how they beat children, young children, old men. I mean, this is crazy. You see that manhandling somebody? What was he doing? He was demonstrating. I mean, I could show you pictures upon pictures. We have thousands of pictures of. You see the Israeli army and not just their police. These are militant how they attack and beat cars. They actually ride in amongst them and you know, they assassinated many of our rabbis. Stop Zionist terrorist massacre in Gaza. These are some of the demonstrations that are happening there. You see they painted the Palestinian flags on the walls. That strikes the Israeli army crazy because you're not allowed to put out Palestinian flags. And they put it on the walls over there. Basically every boy and girl who turns 17 becomes a criminal because we refuse to serve in the army. Here you can see boys and girls get arrested and you can't travel because they refuse to serve in the army. You go to London, you go to the United States. The very religious communities are anti Zionist. In the largest communities here in New York, right across from Manhattan, it's the largest concentration of religious Jews. And they don't have one Israeli flag in our communities. And here they're going to the White House because Bibi, Nathaniel is coming there. Basically, that is the sad history of, of Zionism, that it's coming misrepresenting Judaism. And today that we're speaking today is because of what's happening in Gaza. Gaza now, every minute. I mean, as you know, the world knows, the world sees that they're being bombed to smithereens. They're being destroyed. It's, it's. People are dying, lying and on the rubble, people are dying. And everybody knows this is happening when there's an earthquake in Turkey, there was this terrible earthquake. So the world offered, including ironically, the Israelis, they offered assistance. They're going to go help take the people out from under the Rubble. And everybody came from group, everybody offered medical aid and assistance, said, what can we help you? How can we help you? People are dying under the rubble of houses, that being they're going to be tomorrow, more God forbid. And they're standing there, the world is silent and letting them go on carrying this, this carnage, this destruction of the people of Gaza. We as Jews are crying around the world. We are above, beyond words. As anybody with a human, with a heart, we say, and they're doing it in our name. So we as Jews stand up and we say, this is not in our name. This is, this is a Satan, this is a, a criminal. This is a Nakba. And it's. And, and it's. We can't you dare not be silent. So they, they bring up the point that 1400 people were killed that brought about this thing. They say they're liars. It's not 1400 people that were killed. It's 75 years of Jews, first of all, that they murder. And also Jews that die because they wanted their state. How dare they try to distract the people, you know, to try to obfuscate, to try to divert the attention from the fact that we were living together. There were no death. There was no death when we were living together, Jews and Muslims, for hundreds of years, we enjoyed our children's company, we flourished, they came along. And since then, this death is. The hands are dripping with blood of not only the Palestinians In Gaza today, 75 years and more, their hands are dripping with the blood of Jews because they're trying to push through their folly, their selfish state. So I'm like, I have to end just two little points here. So like I was saying that Zionism is totally contradictory to our Torah. The state of Israel is contradictory to our Torah. We're not allowed to kill or steal. Hundreds of years, the Muslim countries provided a safe haven for us. We flourished amongst them. And including in the Ottoman Empire, which includes in Palestine. So now the Zionists, in order to create their narrative, in order to create their country, they have to create a narrative and say, oh, it's because the Muslims hate the Jews and they're anti Semitic and that's the reason why they're opposing us. They totally don't say that they're occupying all the land, close to 500 villages or more, and that destroyed their homes and their oppression that they don't talk about. And they counted on that people in the world didn't know what's happening in power because it was before Internet, before even more television and stuff. So they were able to use the lack of knowledge of the world and say that, oh, it's because they hate the Jews. That's deplorable. That's disgusting. That's. How dare they. People who did such kindness to us to turn around and to vilify the Muslims and to vilify the people of Palestine because you want to push through your occupation. So it's so immoral. But they don't have God's morals because they're not religious. It's a, it's, it's, it's a base material movement. It's a nationalist movement. So we, we, we say that every and every thing that they're doing is the works of Shatan, of the Satan. We're not allowed to have a state. We're not allowed to oppress. We're not. And, and then to vi. People who are so kind to us. So this is, and accuse everybody of being anti Semitic. That's one of their toys that they're the ploys to get. What they're doing is they accuse everybody being anti Semitic. And, and they use that especially now if the Holocaust, the Holocaust came about. So now Netanyahu uses this constantly. I mean, every day he's constantly, he's constantly turning to the Torah and claiming God gave us the right to the land, it's ours, as he places on psychologically on the minds of the world. And he makes this like a Jewish Muslim conflict. And therefore he vilifies the people of Gaza and that they're all like racist anti Semites and therefore, of course anti west and so forth. And in that manner he, the world is silent because they believe. Yeah. You know, after all, these people are like some type of a nut. They're almost like animals. And they say that also, you know, therefore it's like almost it comes to them what's happening. So Nathaniel, you're asking nothing. Yo, personally, I mean, obviously I'm not, I'm not in this, in a politics. We don't deal with politics at all. We're dealing with Judaism. We're dealing purely that they stole our name, they stole the name of Judaism and they're, they're, they're perpetrating their crime constantly. In the name of my religion. God gives, gives the power to the Satan to be able to fool people because God is testing the world. The Almighty is testing the world. He wants to see how a person will act, you know, on the test. That's what God wants of the humanity. So one, one period of time it was something, one issue and the one that is. And then in the different type periods of the world with the different tests to the world, there was a tower, the Babel, the Tower of Babel, where they wanted to rebel. Each time there's different tests. Now you see when, when Zionism came about, right, that when in 1948 this, the United nations was created, it was just before that created. It was a fledgling, it was a new creation of a union of nations. Why? To bring peace to the world. That there shouldn't be a second world War. There shouldn't be a rather another world war after what happened to the destruction and in Europe. So look how ironic this is. They created this, that there should be peace. And then one of the first things they did that came out of the United nations was the ratification of creating the state of Israel. Now look what we're doing here. You have Palestine. It's a land that the fabric is a beautiful fabric of. Now they're going to implement and they're going to ratify to create the state of Israel, which means a Jewish state, according to them, on the heads and shoulders of the majority that's Muslim. I'm asking you, is that a piece, Is that a way of creating peace? It's the most absurd thing to do when you're going to take a minority and put them in control over the majority. What will happen? What will be the result? The result will be will explode thousands of students in the school, by the way. And you want to catch Mr. Hamas, tell me which international law, which mind human, a base human being will say that it's permissible to bomb a whole school of thousands of children because somebody escaped and went into that. It defies anything that's people call humane. We call godly. It's totally corrupt. It's against everything that's. That the world was created. Where is the world? Where is the United States? Where is Britain? Where is everybody? But it seems that like we say it's Satan that's, that's able to confuse the world. Okay, we'll let you bomb Hamas. So what's going to happen first of war, when you bomb Hamas? Every family that you kill, there's. There's tens, there's thousands, there's hundreds of relatives, there's hundred people. You're making core enemies of you. They'll never forget their relatives that were killed. The people that are missing limbs, the people. What are you creating here? You're creating a worse situation every day that you're bombing. It's. I mean it's beyond what it's so beyond logic. So you're asking me how is that possible? I'm saying because they were able to convince the world that this, it's. It's a religious conflict, it's between Jews and Muslims. These are anti Semites. How are they able to do it? It's like I say, it defies logic. It's the works of Satan, but it's false. The state of Israel is the. The epitome, is the essence, is the personification of anti Semitism. They are the ones that are murdering people. The, the people of Gaza, the people of Palestine and the Jews that in the 1400 people, their hands are dripping with the blood of the 1400 people. Again, without justifying the ones who killed what was saying there. If it wouldn't be for the state of Israel, this wouldn't have happened. They. And it's not necessary. It's not necessary. It's not the Judaism, it's not the religious Judaism. It's a political flawed movement that started 150 years ago. Judaism is 3,000 years. Leave us alone, stop using our names, stop telling the world you are representing it. So their hands are covered in blood. They are as anti Semitism. Yet in Britain, in the United States, every place they equate Judaism and Zionism. If you speak against the state, you're an anti Semite. You're not allowed to make a wave of Palestinian flag. I think of Britain now and it's like crazy things are happening. Germany maybe, I remember. But you're not allowed to. You're not allowed to speak against the state of Israel. It's unbelievable. It's incomprehensible and it's wrong. It's criminal, criminal to support the state of Israel. It's criminal not to stand up. It's criminal to be silent when people are being murdered. People are lying in excruciating pain in the wards of the hospitals because they don't have anesthesia. We dare not be silent. We dare not be as Jews. We plead with the world. We plead with the world. Please don't use our name. Don't buy into this faith fake narrative of Zionism and let's stop the killing. Yeah, I'm sorry. He asked me about Netanyahu and I didn't even get him. I've forgotten, apologize. Netanyahu is just one more of these leaders who like Sharon, who's like these warmonger leaders. But it's. And of course many people say that he goes, tries to save himself, that he was in the corner and his very simple Route out of the corner is like many unfortunately in history. We find that they create a war. When there's a war then the country forgets everything. That all the issues that are on the table and they back and they become loyal to the country and they stop, you know and anybody dares talk about any side and then say oh you're not loyal to the country. And he knew that. I mean it's a basic logic was probably that that's what's happening here and they should have not not only they should not be victorious but that the whole state of Israel God told speed of peace should collapse, it should end, God should help speeding and peacefully. The world should get so shocked but what's happening today that they should say enough is enough and you should and it should turn it turn around on him. You know, that he shouldn't have what is what he's dreaming for. But basically we find that he was you know constantly with the right. He goes with the, with the what they call the right extreme. And we have to be very careful. You have to know that the settlers, a lot of these guys are idealists and they look like religious people but it's clear again you go around the world the very religious. You go to London, it was Stamford Hills, you come to New York, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Mayesharam, Jerusalem. Invariably the very religious are opposed dead set against the state of Israel. Not only the occupation there in Gaza and over the occupation and the settlements and the existence of the state. But the world doesn't know this. They constantly see the settlers and a lot of the settlers idealists that came from universities who thought it means to be a good Jew. They would come from non religious homes usually or for marginally religious means. They, they don't, they're. It's a compromised religion these guys ideas. So they think oh we're going to get even. They put their lives in danger and the children's lives in danger by going to SETT elements. You know, they think that oh we're doing God's will because Zionism Incorporated. They conflated they, they try to fool people. Like I said, they use the name Israel, Star of David and they tell people oh this is God's dream that to end exile. We had Hitler, we had the Nazis and now we have to go and return to the lands. They use emotions and they fool a lot of these. That's. I'm not condoning these settlers but they got fooled into this belief and these extremists always are in the news. So people think this is religious Jewry, when on the contrary, all the very religious opposite. We go out and demonstrate. But you should just know you don't see the vast majority of religious Jews because people are afraid to stand up and demonstrate because they're brutally beaten and killed and arrested in Israel just this last week. Last week, I think, was two weeks ago. Now it's four weeks. They went out and demonstrated in Jerusalem and there was a viral video went around how the Zionists are beating people who went out to demonstrate in front of Netanyahu's house. They went out, don't think it stopped there. They went and they broke into the homes of the ones who demonstrated in the middle of the night. They destroyed their apartments. They took, of course, the computers and everything, and they arrested them. This happens daily to us, but especially now in this situation. So many. And we went out to demonstrate in Manhattan. We came back, our tires were slashed, the windows were broken, the mirror was broken from the car, the cars were. This is what they do to us. They threaten our lives. They call us. They threaten our lives. And so people are afraid to stand up and speak out, even around the world. So you would see much more that. Now, Nathaniel is, is a very glib. He has a silky voice and he presents himself and always uses the Torah. He goes to Congress, he goes to the United nations, always talks about God gave us the land, counting knowing on the ignorance. He's not a fool. He. But he's. He's evil, but not a fool. He's sly. He knows that the world doesn't know the, the truth of the Torah, that all the rabbinical authorities are opposing. He know that they're opposed to it and, and he knows that it's not true what he's saying, but they don't have the morals of the Torah because it's not from God. They're ready to sacrifice on the altar of Zionism all the, not only Palestinian lives and Muslim lives and Christianized, but Jewish lives also just to reach the goal of having a state. So they don't. They're plotting on what will be. We're not prophets. You ask me what will be. We're not prophets. We don't know. But we have to know. We have to first educate the world, let the world know they're being conned. They think it's a religious conflict. So they're thinking in one track and constantly trying to see how to somehow solve the problem. Because after all, first of all, the Jews suffered in the Holocaust. They were murdered and the world was silent. They Feel they have a guilt feeling. There was a guilt around the world for their silence and they want to support them. People mean well. Other people have other issues that they, they want to. The they want. By supporting Israel, it's Judaism and Zionism are contradictory. And by supporting Zionism, you're supporting the development of anti Semitism and of murder of the Palestinian people. It's all bad. By supporting them, the world has to understand what are you doing? First of all, Hamas is the government over there. That means the medical offices, that means that everything, the social workers. What do you mean going to wipe out Hamas? It's crazy. 40 years ago was the Hamas. There was no chance. There was people, there was something before that you can't destroy, you can't oppress the people. And again, we're not condoning violence. We can't oppress the people and expect that they're going to stand there and say, yeah, fine, we love you, I'm going to take your occupation. They want. When one of our rabbis said, they want peace, we want peace. They want a peaceful occupation, that's what they want. We want peace, but they want a peaceful occupation. But the world has to recognize the sickness in order to prescribe a solution. If they're not going to recognize the sickness, one day will come when the world will wake up and they'll see that it's, it's, it's horrendous what they're doing to the people of Gaza. It's unacceptable. And it's not anti Semitism to oppose it, it's antisemitism to support it. So that is what we have to. We, we're not, we're not prophets, but we have to give the world the facts and that they should be able to distinguish from the truth and what Zionism is telling them, that it's not a religious conflict and you're not anti Semitic to stand up. What will happen? I don't know. I can't tell you. But we have to stand up. Obviously, our solution is, first of all, we believe that one God who's great, who rules the world and he's compassionate. We don't understand when he brings a tsunami, a plague or whatever, or on this mass murder. We pray, we say to everybody to first of all, pray to the Almighty because it's in his hands. Just like USSR went peacefully almost overnight. Same thing with the apartheid ended and it's finished. We have to pray to the Almighty with his immense power, with his unending power and his compassion to bring an end. God should help because he's so powerful God that he could do it, that it should happen miraculously, speeding and peacefully. He should bring an end to the occupation entirely to the existence into one inch of this state of Israel. That's a rebellion against God. That's first of all we urge everybody to do that. Secondly, we urge everybody do not be intimidated. Look at our communities. You can point to our communities. You can show that the very religious Jewish communities, whether it's in New York, in Jerusalem, whether it's in London, invariably the very religious communities around the world, I'm telling you in Argentina and Montreal, the most religious are anti Zionist. These people of compassion, Jewish people who are God fearing, who live their lives as respectable God fearing and they're all opposed to the state of Israel. So therefore take courage from that. Speak up and let the world know. Don't call it the Jewish state or the Jews speak up against the occupation and that will and the solution when again we have to stand up stubbornly because eventually two state is not a solution. Palestinians want to go home to the home, to their homes in Jerusalem. They don't want even one inch of them. You can't take them away. They have the right Allah, the right of return. They want to return to all of what was theirs. You can't steal from the same oh break and take over a whole house and then make a compromise, give back here for the house. When the world realizes that being duped by the Zionists and that they're simply being forced to into a quack, into an evil, there will be a change. Maybe this will bring about what's happening in Gaza now. And when they, then they will stop supporting this occupation, there will be an end and we can live together. History shows we live together. It's not, it's not a silly issue. The world would want to come to the realization that it's wrong the support of the occupation, then we can't come to the relationship of sitting together the leaders of these different representatives of the different people in Palestine and they would want to, to come to a system of coexistence under a free Palestine. You would see as long as we're not trying to occupy them, we can't. Now there's hundreds of people or maybe thousands of people who are, who will be say that they committed atrocities in Gaza and in the, in the, in the prison camps. And these people may say we don't feel safe. We have 50 states in the United States, we have people around the world. People don't cannot be outspoken. They're afraid I'm not condoning the design.
